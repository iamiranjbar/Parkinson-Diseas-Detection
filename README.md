# Parkinson-Diseas-Detection

This is the final project of Machine Learning course at the University of Tehran.

We develop a machine learning model to predict parkinson disease from voice of patients in early stages of disease. In this disease, patient's formants sound differently.

We use different methods and analyse them. At the end, we choose best model and features for predicting. We use cross validaiton to evaluate our models.
